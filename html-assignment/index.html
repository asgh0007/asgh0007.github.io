        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is <b>Mazen Asghar</b>. I was born in <em>Saudi Arabia</em> and have a <em>Pakistani</em> nationality.
            In my life, I have moved and travelled alot due to various reasons. From Saudi arabia to Pakistan when I was 11,
            then to Saudi Arabia again when I was 17 and then to Canada when I was 21. Even in Canada I have been living in various places
            Winnipeg, Brantford, Toronto, Ottawa etc. I have also visited alot of different countries before coming to Canada like France, Italy, 
            Switzerland, Norway, Turkey, UAE, Denmark etc. 
        </p>
        <p>Since I have visited so many places, the one thing I always do is to try out all the local cuisines that i can. As can be seen, I am a quite the foodie. 
            Apart from that, I also love to go to the gym. Although i would say that I have a love hate relationship with that. I am also an avid reader and love to read as a past time.</p>

            One of my favourite motivational quote is,
             <blockquote>“The Best Way To Get Started Is To Quit Talking And Begin Doing.” -<cite>Walt Disney</cite></blockquote>
